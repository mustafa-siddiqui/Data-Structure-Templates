# Data-Structure-Templates
Simple data structure templates written using modern c++.

Made as a learning project to learn and implement modern C++ functionalities including but not limited to template classes, move semantics, smart pointers, OOP concepts like class relations, and design principles.

## Overview
Custom data structures like a node, doubly linked list and more (to come).

## Sample Usage
Sample usage files are in `src` e.g. `src/linkedListUsage.cc`
