# Data-Structure-Templates
Simple data structure templates written using modern c++.

Made as a learning project to learn and implement modern C++ functionalities including but not limited to template classes, move semantics, smart pointers, OOP concepts like class relations, and design principles.

### Latest Progress

Node ID assignment seems to be fine. Could be implemented in a more robust and better way, but this is fine for our purposes.

### To-do

- [x] Fix `LinkedList.deleteNode()`
- [ ] Implement `LinkedList.find()`
- [ ] Implement `LinkedList.insertBefore()`
- [ ] Implement `LinkedList.insertAfter()`
